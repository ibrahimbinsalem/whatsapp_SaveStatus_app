# whatsapp_dawnloader

A new Flutter project.

## Status Saver Notes

- Android only: WhatsApp status files are read from the `.Statuses` folders.
- If you cannot see statuses, open WhatsApp > Status first, then tap Scan in the app.
- Saved copies are stored in `Pictures/Status Saver` and appear in the gallery after a scan.
- iOS does not expose WhatsApp status files; sharing works only via the Share Extension flow.
